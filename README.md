### About
This package provides tools to download records from the [PubMed](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/) database based on user-specified search criteria, and to add commonly used bibliometrics for the returned records. The output is always in a tidy data format, making it easy to analyse the data using tools from the 'tidyverse'
