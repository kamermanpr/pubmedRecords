## About

This package provides tools to download records from the [PubMed](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/) database based on user-specified search criteria, and to add commonly used bibliometrics for the returned records. The output is always in a tidy data format, making it easy to analyse the data using tools from the 'tidyverse'

***This package is still in development.*** If you do give it try, and you find a bug, please report it under '[issues](https://github.com/kamermanpr/pubmedrecords/issues)'.
